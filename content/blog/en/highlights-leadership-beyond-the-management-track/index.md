Hello again! I've just finished this really nice reading that I highly recommend and I thought: why not sharing my highlights publicly then?
Hope it makes you interested to buy and reading the whole book, enjoy!

p.s the highlights will be organized by chapter


<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Foreword</h2>

- “senior” level on (and arguably earlier), technical skills aren’t enough. Success will often mean interpreting business needs, communicating a clear direction, defusing a looming crisis, convincing teams to agree on tradeoffs, or just being a good influence.


<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Staff engineer archetypes</h2>

- Being a Staff-engineer is not just a role. It’s the intersection of the role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization’s recognition of all those things.

- Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company, for example, the company’s API design, frontend stack, storage strategy, or cloud infrastructure. For a domain to merit an Architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company’s success.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">What do staff engineers actually do?</h2>

- The role of a Staff-plus engineer depends a lot on what the team needs and also what the particular engineer’s strengths are. From my experience, the responsibilities of a Staff-plus engineer can change over time. Still, usually, their main focus is working on projects/ efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team.-Diana Pojar

- Setting and editing technical direction, providing sponsorship and mentorship, injecting engineering context into organizational decisions, exploration, and what Tanya Reilly calls being glue.

- Much as the Lorax speaks for the trees in his popular children’s book, Staff engineers speak for their companies’ technology. Technology cannot speak for itself and requires effective advocates on its behalf. Folks who successfully advance technology are pragmatic, deliberate, and focus more on the long-term trend of progress than viewing each individual decision as a make-or-break crisis. It can be helpful to think of this as being a part-time product manager for technology.

- One constant across all roles is that the reality of setting technical direction is far more about understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you and far less about prioritizing technology and approaches that you personally are excited to learn about. In earlier roles, you may have tried to influence decisions towards technology choices you were motivated by; in senior positions, you’re accountable to the business and organization first and yourself second.

- You’re far more likely to change your company’s long-term trajectory by growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Operating at staff</h2>

- One of the best pieces of advice that someone gave me, and that I make sure to pass on to other staff engineers, is that there’s a misconception that you become a Staff engineer and then you’ll be in control of the work you do, and everyone will listen to you and do what you want them to do. That’s absolutely the opposite of what happens!-Katie Sylor-Miller.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Work on what matters</h2>

- We only get value from finishing projects, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage. Time spent getting work finished is always time well spent.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Writing engineering strategy</h2>

- To write an engineering strategy, write five design documents, and pull the similarities out. That’s your engineering strategy. To write an engineering vision, write five engineering strategies, and forecast their implications two years into the future. That’s your engineering vision.

- Write design documents for any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects. You should also write design documents for projects that meaningfully impact your users. You should write a design document for any work taking more than a month of engineering time.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">To lead, you have to follow</h2>

- What you can accomplish alone is far from what you can accomplish by creating leaders. To be a great leader, take your time learning to follow.


<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Learn to never be wrong</h2>

- Good meetings start from a clear purpose and agenda, but many meetings don’t meet that definition, particularly ad-hoc discussions. If you ever find yourself in a conversation with an unclear goal, then define the purpose. Take a moment to ask if your understanding of what the group hopes to accomplish is correct. This works best as a statement wrapped in a clarifying question along the lines of, “Just to check, our goal here is to decide whether to postpone launching the project by two weeks?”

<h3>Don't be a jerk</h3>

- A jerk is someone who withholds their consent from the group, isn’t willing to compromise, or doesn’t listen. This is someone who hasn’t learned that their career depends more on being easy to involve than being technically correct.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Being visible</h2>

- If you’re fortunate, then you won’t have to pursue a deliberate path to a Staff-plus role. You’re already working on your company’s top priorities, have a well-positioned manager who cares about supporting your career and are working from your company’s headquarters office.

- Write and distribute more long-lived documents, like architecture docs or technical specification.

- Lead (and, to a lesser extent, participate in) company forums like architecture reviews, company all hands, and learning circles.


<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Interviews with staff engineers around the world</h2>

<h3>Michelle Bu - Payments Products tech lead at stripe</h3>

- I’ve taken to using the word “energized” over “impactful.” “Impactful” feels company-centric, and while that’s important, “energized” is more inwards-looking. Finding energizing work is what has kept me at Stripe for so long, pursuing impactful work.

<h3>Nelson Elhage - Formerly staff engineer at stripe</h3>

- Something else that has been quite valuable for me is estimation. I find it really valuable to be able to look at a system and have the habit of estimating how many gigabytes-per-second is this thing, or how much storage would this data take? You don’t have to get it perfect, getting the nearest power of ten is usually enough to be useful.

<h3>Diana Pojar - Staff Data Engineer at Slack</h3>

- I’m also able to uplevel others that are more junior and make their voices heard. Having a Staff + title brings some privilege that others don’t have and I try to leverage that to help uplevel my team / peers.

- In general, I’ve always tried to be very intentional with my career choices and usually I spend some time every year to think about what I’m doing and the areas of growth that I want to focus on. I’ve found this extremely valuable, because it makes me take a step back and assess what I am currently doing, to ask if I’m still growing in my current environment and think about new opportunities.

- Something that I felt was extremely helpful was to understand that a Staff + Engineer’s work and responsibility is more than writing code. Basically what got you to senior level will not get you to Staff +. It’s important to understand the expectations of this role in your company, but also in the industry as a whole, as there are some differences between companies.

<h3>Dan Na - Staff Engineer and Team lead at Squarspace</h3>

- You first got the title Staff engineer at Squarespace. What was the process of getting promoted to Staff? I was hired as a Senior Software Engineer II (one level below Staff). I was fortunate to land on a team working on a high impact project that I was able to contribute to immediately. The hardest parts about the project concerned a problem space I was already familiar with—wide, sweeping changes across codebases—and I proposed, prototyped and eventually shipped an alternative architecture that I felt would better position the company for success. That became our frontend translation system, which I wrote about on our engineering blog: Building a System for Frontend Translations.

- I think sponsorship is a key responsibility of any senior role and material to the growth of any engineering organization. I suppose the definition of “sponsorship” varies, but to me one tangible way is to provide opportunities for exposure. For example: Giving less senior teammates the opportunity to own and present their work at wider meetings. Reaching out to a team who just shipped an awesome feature to write a post for our engineering blog. Encouraging someone I met in a #connect-engineering coffee who has unique experience or perspective to give an internal presentation. Ensuring that meetings are not dominated by the perspectives of a vocal minority and soliciting opinions from everyone in the room. Giving public kudos in a large slack room to someone who just did something great that everyone didn’t see. Lara Hogan has a great post on sponsorship in practice: What does sponsorship look like?

<h3>Damian Schenkelman - Principal Engineer at Auth0</h3>

- “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”

<h3>Dmitry Petrashko - Tech Advisor to the Head of infrastructure at Stripe</h3>

- A Staff Engineer at Stripe isn’t a role, rather it’s a level that corresponds to expectation of impact, communication, people and project leadership skills.

- At least, at Stripe, Staff Engineers work on very different areas. Make sure you agree with your reporting chain on what is the impact you should be achieving and what are the things you’re allowed to compromise on on the way to that impact. Communicate clearly what compromises you’re doing and why.
  
<h3>Stephen Wan - Starr Engineer at Samsara</h3>

- Get comfortable talking a lot. I think a big step-change between Senior and Staff roles ends up being the focus on people: reconciling competing priorities, clearing up miscommunication, aligning folks on the same page. Even though they typically don’t have direct reports, Staff engineers are working in a system of both the technology and the people: the biggest impact is going to come from influencing both.

- love reading blogs and papers that really go in depth in a technical area. A few that I’ve come back to over the years include: Bob Nystrom’s blog posts on programming languages Vyacheslav Egorov’s blog about compilers and V8 internals (Chrome’s JS engine) Brandur’s blog on various systems topics Nelson Elhage’s Accidentally Quadratic Vicki Pfau’s Blog on developing a GameBoy Advance emulator fail0overflow’s blog and talks about console architecture and exploits Bungie’s engineering publications on building and producing the original Halo games

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">Ending words</h2>

- By improving ourselves, we make the industry better. Make a plan to sponsor someone else in your organization. Synthesize a strategy document, taking the time to make others feel heard. Build a network of peers, and invite more folks into that network.

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">additional resources on Staff-plus engineering</h2>

- Almost unanimously, Staff-plus engineers’ most valuable learning resources wasn’t a book, blog, talk, or paper, but instead their network of peers and mentors. If you only have one hour to develop yourself as an engineer, your best bet would be building a network of people in similar roles.

- If you’re looking for a Slack community, #staff-principal-engineering in the Rands Leadership Slack is a fairly lively room.

Although I’ve found that many folks don’t read too many books, when I asked Staff engineers for their most valuable resources, they inevitably mentioned a personal mentor or a book. They had blog posts and tech talks they might mention related to a more specific problem, but they were most changed by this larger, more papery format. Some books which were recommended:

  - A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout.
  - Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim 
  - Becoming a Technical Leader: An Organic Problem-Solving Approach by Gerald Weinberg Building Evolutionary Architectures by Ford, Parsons, and Kua 
  - Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value by Melissa Perri 
  - Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters by Richard Rumelt 
  - High Output Management by Andy Grove The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change by Camille Fournier 
  - The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks The Phoenix Project by Kim, Behr, and Spafford. 
  - The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler 
  - The Pragmatic Programmer by Hunt and Thomas Resilient Management by Lara Hogan.
